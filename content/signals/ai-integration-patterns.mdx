## The Integration Challenge

Adding AI to existing systems is often done poorly. Intelligence is bolted on, creating complexity and technical debt.

## Integration Patterns

We use proven patterns for integrating AI:

- **Intelligence as Service**: AI capabilities exposed as services, not embedded
- **Event-Driven Intelligence**: AI triggered by events, not polling
- **Gradual Integration**: Incremental enhancement, not big-bang replacement

## Architecture Benefits

- **Maintainability**: AI components isolated and replaceable
- **Scalability**: Intelligence scales independently
- **Testability**: AI components testable in isolation

## Real-World Application

These patterns have been applied in production systems, handling millions of requests while maintaining system reliability and performance.

## Lessons Learned

AI integration is an architectural concern, not a feature concern. Design systems where intelligence enhances, not complicates.
