## The Challenge

Most analytics systems operate on batch processing. Data is collected, stored, processed, and then insights are delivered hours or days later.

## Our Approach

We architect systems where analytics happens in real-time. Data flows through the system, insights are computed on-the-fly, and decisions can be made immediately.

## Architecture Patterns

- **Stream Processing**: Data flows continuously, not in batches
- **Event-Driven Analytics**: Insights triggered by events, not schedules
- **In-Memory Computation**: Fast enough for real-time decision making

## Business Impact

Real-time analytics transforms how organizations operate. Decisions are made on current data, not historical data. Opportunities are captured as they happen, not after they've passed.

## Implementation

This isn't about faster batch processing. It's about fundamentally different architecture—streaming, event-driven, and real-time by design.
