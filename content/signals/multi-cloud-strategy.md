## The Vendor Lock-In Problem

Most organizations choose a single cloud provider. This creates dependency, limits options, and increases risk.

## Our Strategy

We design multi-cloud architectures that leverage the strengths of different providers while maintaining portability and flexibility.

## Key Principles

- **Cloud-Agnostic Core**: Core logic independent of cloud provider
- **Provider-Specific Optimization**: Leverage unique strengths where it matters
- **Portability First**: Systems that can move, not systems that must stay

## Architecture Approach

Multi-cloud isn't about using every provider. It's about strategic use of multiple providers to achieve resilience, cost optimization, and flexibility.

## Business Benefits

- Reduced vendor dependency
- Cost optimization across providers
- Geographic redundancy
- Regulatory compliance flexibility

## Implementation

Multi-cloud architecture requires careful design. We build systems where cloud provider is a configuration, not a constraint.
