## The Scale Problem

Scale is not a number. It's a property of architecture. Systems that scale are architected for scale from the beginning, not scaled after the fact.

## Distributed State

State management is the core challenge of distributed systems. We design architectures where state is distributed by design, not centralized and then distributed.

## Failure as Design Constraint

Failures are not exceptions. They're design constraints. We architect systems where failure modes are understood and handled gracefully.

## Consistency Models

Strong consistency is expensive. Eventual consistency is complex. We choose consistency models based on architectural needs, not default assumptions.

## Network as Architecture

The network is not transparent. It's a fundamental part of system architecture. We design with network characteristics as first-class concerns.
