## Intelligence in Production

Most intelligence research focuses on models. We focus on systems. How do you build production systems where intelligence is a first-class architectural concern?

## Distributed Learning Systems

Traditional ML pipelines are centralized. We research architectures where learning happens across distributed systems, enabling scale and resilience.

## Real-Time Adaptation

Systems should adapt in real-time, not through batch retraining. We research architectures that enable continuous learning and adaptation.

## Cost-Effective Intelligence

Intelligence should be cost-effective at scale. We research architectures that maintain performance while reducing computational costs.

## Observability of Intelligence

Understanding how intelligent systems make decisions is critical. We research architectures that provide transparency and observability into system intelligence.
