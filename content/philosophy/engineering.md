## Architecture Over Infrastructure

Infrastructure is a means, not an end. We focus on architectural decisions that create lasting value, not infrastructure choices that become technical debt.

## Systems Thinking

Every component exists within a system. We design with system-level understanding, considering interactions, dependencies, and emergent behaviors.

## Research-Driven Development

Engineering decisions should be informed by research and evidence, not assumptions. We maintain a research-driven approach to all architectural decisions.

## Minimal Complexity

Complexity is the enemy of maintainability. We design systems with minimal necessary complexity, removing abstractions that don't serve clear purposes.

## Long-Term Thinking

Systems outlive their initial requirements. We design for evolution, not just current needs. Architecture should enable future changes, not constrain them.

## Production Reality

Theoretical elegance must meet production reality. We design systems that are elegant in theory and robust in practice, tested under real-world conditions.
