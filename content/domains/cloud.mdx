Cloud infrastructure should be architected, not configured. We design systems where infrastructure decisions are architectural decisions.

## Multi-Cloud Foundations

We design for cloud-agnostic architectures that leverage the strengths of multiple providers while maintaining portability and resilience.

## Cost as Architecture

Cost optimization is an architectural concern. We design systems where efficiency is built into the architecture, not optimized after the fact.

## Observability by Design

Observability is not instrumentation added later. It's designed into the system from the ground up, enabling true system understanding.
