Visualization is not decoration. It's communication.

## The Visualization Challenge

Data without understanding is noise. Visualization bridges the gap between data and insight.

## Strategic Visualization

We design visualizations that:

- **Reveal patterns**: Not just display data
- **Enable decisions**: Not just inform
- **Scale understanding**: From individual to organization

## Implementation

Visualization systems must be:

- **Fast**: Real-time insights, not batch reports
- **Flexible**: Adapt to new questions, not fixed dashboards
- **Intuitive**: Understanding without training

The goal is not beautiful charts. The goal is better decisions.
