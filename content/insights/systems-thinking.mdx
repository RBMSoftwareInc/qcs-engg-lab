Every component exists within a system. This seems obvious, but in practice, we often design components in isolation.

## The Isolation Problem

When we design components independently, we optimize for local efficiency. But systems have emergent properties that don't exist at the component level.

## Designing for Emergence

Instead of designing components, we should design interactions. The system's behavior emerges from how components interact, not from what each component does in isolation.

## Practical Implications

- Design APIs that reveal system state
- Build observability into interactions, not components
- Test system behavior, not component behavior

Systems thinking is not a methodology. It's a way of seeing.
