Cost is often treated as an operational concern. Something to optimize after the system is built.

## The Post-Optimization Problem

When cost is an afterthought, optimization becomes constraint. We're forced to make trade-offs that compromise architecture.

## Cost by Design

Cost should be an architectural constraint from the beginning. Not a limit to work within, but a design parameter to work with.

## Architectural Cost Decisions

- Data locality reduces network costs
- Caching strategies reduce compute costs
- Event-driven architectures reduce coupling costs

Cost is not a budget. It's a design constraint.
